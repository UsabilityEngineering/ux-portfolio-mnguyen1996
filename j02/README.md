As I made lunch on a typical weekday, I noticed that I can document my experience with my air fryer. This air fryer has been my most used appliance for the past year, and I've been loving it so far. At first glance you can see litted on/off switch that is a touch button right in the center. You can also see a Wi-Fi symbol on the left side, which means that this air fryer can be connected to the internet router which can be control from phones and computers. As I turn on the air fryer, you can see that there are a lot of more buttons that litted up such as presets and also the temperature and the cook time in digital number format.

Also, if you open and take off the basket from the air fryer while it is on, it will indicate by replacing the number values with dashes for temperature and cook time. This is a safety feature that the company implemented.

Here is the app layout if you were to connect the air fryer to the internet so that you can remotely control and set your air fryer wirelessly.
