As I made lunch on a typical weekday, I've observed carefully on small details such as its functionality of the appliance; in this case an air fryer.

At first glance you can see litted on/off switch that is a touch button right in the center. You can also see a Wi-Fi symbol on the left side, which means that this
air fryer can be connected to the internet router which can be control from phones and computers.

As I turn on the air fryer, you can see that there are a lot of more buttons that litted up, including the temperature and the cook time in digital number.
