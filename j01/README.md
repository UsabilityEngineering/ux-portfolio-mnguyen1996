# UX Journal 1 - Gas eXperience

## Minh Nguyen, 03/07/2021

Ever since the beginning of this course, I've been making side observations of certain technological scenarios throughout some days. 
For instance, this morning I noticed that my car is very low on gas. I had about 15 miles remaining on my gas tank, therefore I had to 
head out to a local gas station. Luckily Costco Gasoline is very cheap compared to many other gas stations, and it is only about 2 miles away
from home. As I parked my car and took the gas pump to fill my gas tank, I noticed something off.
