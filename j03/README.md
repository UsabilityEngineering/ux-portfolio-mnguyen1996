# UX Journal 3- 

## Minh Nguyen, 05/17/2021

For the last journal, I would like to document about my video capture card that I recently got for multiple devices that I own, such as my Nintendo Switch. I use this to output my device into my PC so that I don't have to switch my output on my display every time I want to use it. The connection of the designs consists of the USB connection to the PC which also provides power to the capture card itself, and the HDMI port which connects to the device that I want to output into my PC. In this case as shown below, the HDMI is connected to my Nintendo Switch.

I will now use the application that was provided along with the capture card. Since the initial installation of the software also comes with the driver, it doesn't need any other additional setup in order to get it to work. At first it will show that there's no input connected to the capture card as shown.

But once all connection has been made, the application will flawlessly show the signal of the Nintendo Switch.

Now from here, we can adjust the output setting on the right side such as the game audio and other audio settings for the output. At the bottom, there is also an option to record the output that is being captured from the Nintendo Switch.

There is also some additional settings that can be adjusted in order to optimize for best performance. Performance may be varied depending on the CPU and the GPU. Ideally we want zero latency of the output signal, so it can be adjusted until the goal has been reached.

My overall experience was pleasant. I found out that the ability to use this for any other devices that supports HDMI connection as display is **useful**. For example, I can also use this to capture video input from different devices such as DSLR or mirrorless cameras to my PC to use for recording videos, taking picures, or even use it as a webcam. You can also connect to other game console too as long as they have an HDMI connection for display. I also find that it is **satisfying** and **memorable** to use the user friendly application that is provided with the capture card. Everything is perfectly laid out on the application with straight forward settings.
